== Name
ndppd.conf - ndppd configuration file

== Description

This file is used to describe which interfaces to proxy as well as which rules must match in order to respond to any _neighbor solicitation_ messages.
Most of the configuration options are simple key-value pairs, with the exceptions being *proxy* and *rule* which must also include a block containing
additional configuration options.

A most basic example of this is *valid-ttl* with a configured value of 10000 milliseconds.

    valid-ttl 10000

Which options are valid depends on the block in which they are defined. The example above is allowed at _top level_, but would not be allowed
inside a *rule* or a *proxy* block. Please see _Options_ for details regarding valid configuration options. In order for the *ndppd.conf* to be valid,
at least one *proxy* must be defined. An in each of these proxies, at least one *rule* must be defined.

In short; the general structure of *ndppd.conf* can be simplified to:

[source]
----
...

route eth0 {
    rule dead:beef:: {
        ...
    }
}

=== Comments

*ndppd.conf* supports two types of comments.

C-style

    /* This is a comment */

Python

    # This a comment

==  Options

=== Top-level

*valid-ttl* _milliseconds_::
    The time a target will be considered valid after having received a _neighbor advertisement_ from a neighbor.
+
Default: 30000

*invalid-ttl* _milliseconds_::
    The time a target will be considered invalid after not receiving any _neighbor solicitation_ messages from a neighbor.
+
Default: 5000

*retrans-time* _milliseconds_::
    The time *ndppd* will wait before sending another _neighbor solicitation_ to the internal interface.
+
Default: 1500

*retrans-limit* _count_::
    How many times *ndppd* attempt to send _neighbor solicitation_ messages, and not receiving a valid _neighbor advertisement_ response,
    before considering it being invalid.
+
Default: 3

*proxy* _interface_ _block_::
    Create a new proxy on the specified interface. That interface will be listening for _neighbor solicitation_
    messages and then reply with _neighbor advertisement_ messages if the conditions were met.

    proxy eth0 {
        # Proxy specific configuration
    }


=== Proxy specific

*rule* _ip_ [ */* _prefix_ ] _block_::
    Add a new rule for the matching IPv6 address. If *prefix* is not specified, it defaults to 128. Note that the
    address and prefix must be provided without any whitespace between them.

    rule dead:beef::1/127 {
        # Route specific configuration
    }

=== Rule specific

auto::
    If specified, *ndppd* will attempt to automatically determine where to forward _Neighbor Solicitation_ messages.
    This feature uses the *Netlink* protocol.

static::
    Automatically respond. *This option is mutually exclusive with iface and auto*.

*iface* _interface_::
    Forwards the *Neighbor Solicitation* message through this specific interface.

*autowire*::
    A flag whether or not a new route should be automatically added to the routing table if a match has been found.

*table* _index_::
    Indicates which routing table should be used when *auto* and *autowire* is used.
