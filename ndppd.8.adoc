== Name
ndppd - neighbor advertisement proxy daemon for IPv6

== Synopsis
*ndppd* [ *-dvs* ] [ *-c* _config_file_ ] [ *-p* _pid_file_ ]

== Description
*ndppd* is a neighbor advertisement proxy daemon; it allows a host to proxy neighbor discovery
messages between interfaces to allow routing of otherwise non-routable IPv6 addresses.
It implements part of *RFC 4861*.

== Options

*-c*, *--config*=_path_::
    Location of the configuration file.
+
Default: /etc/ndppd.conf

*-p*, *--pidfile*=_path_::
    Path to the pidfile. Used in conjunction with *-d* or *--daemon*.

*-d*, *--daemon*::
    Puts the daemon into the background. If *-p* or *--pidfile* has been provided, *ndppd* will lock the
    specified file and write the PID of the newly spawned child to it. The file remains locked until the
    child terminates.

*-s*, *--syslog*::
    Force the use of syslog even if *ndppd* is not running as a daemon.

*-v*, *--verbose*::
    Increase the verbosity of the logging. Multiple *-v* increases the verbosity even further.
